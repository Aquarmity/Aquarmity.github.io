This song served as my introduction to SikTh, and their often-chaotic double lead vocal style with its constant back and forth. It blew my mind, but also, of course, quite hard to listen to at first. Representing a nightmare in this way, the panic involved in such — "where are we? — I thought you knew? — Who the fuck are you? — Oh no!" — is perfect. There are momentary escapes from this in the chorus, but then you fall back into the bad dream. I'm not entirely sure if you would consider this to be a "concept album," especially since this song has really nothing to do with bleak outlook on the future that other songs on this album address (if anything, this song is like falling into the backrooms and searching for some kind of escape), but I'm going to just pretend this song ties in with the rest based on the outro: "Wake in light of day, but nothing seems the same." It's like waking up from a nightmare only to find out that the real world has become a nightmare of its own overnight. Nothing is as it was when you fell asleep.
