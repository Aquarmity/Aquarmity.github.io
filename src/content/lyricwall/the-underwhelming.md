I had the wonderful opportunity to see Puscifer live on the Sessanta tour. A highlight I didn't quite expect was hearing The Underwhelming, and specifically one musician's performance on it: Carina Round. Although this was the fourth concert I had been to, I hadn't actually seen any female musicians live up until this point, and I really was missing out because Carina absolutely killed it here. Maynard and Carina in all of their songs together compliment each other perfectly, and I love what they do here with the harmonies, the echoes of the chorus's lyrics, and especially the "da da da da"s (all of which were even better live). That's not even to mention the awesome groove and delicious guitar and bass tones this song has.
