In the summer of 2023 I went to see Between the Buried and Me live with my friend, my first proper "metal" concert. The opening acts were Rivers of Nihil and Thank You Scientist, both of whom I had hardly listened to anything of before, so I went in to the show knowing practically nothing about this band. I remember at the beginning of the show, as Rivers of Nihil were taking stage, that I was trying to say something to my friend, but I was suddenly cut off mid-sentence by the beginning of this song. It was at that moment I knew... I should've brought earplugs.

Because of that unfortunate fact, I couldn't enjoy the band as much as I should've in the moment, I was more focused on making sure I'd be able to hear after the night. But still, this concert put the band on my radar, and going back to listen to them later, I ended up liking them a lot more than I expected I would. I chose to use this lyric here because of just how gnarly it is delivered. It's not often you have multiple harsh vocalists in a band, so combining Jake Diffenbach's raw power with Adam Biggs's distorted fry screaming (don't fact check me, I don't know if I'm correctly identifying his technique) results in this demonic tone.
