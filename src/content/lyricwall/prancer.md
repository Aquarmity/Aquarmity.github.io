Hearing this song for the first time, I really had no idea if I would like it. I was used to intense music, but this was a bit much. And then, oops, a month later it's my favorite song at that moment, and now according to Spotify, my third most listened to song of the past year (as of June 2024). A big reason for that is the section from 1:49 to around 2:53. The quiet, calm break that breaks open after only ten seconds or so to the pounding drums, which build up to the "empty lips just for distraction" moment so perfectly, and circling back to the opening guitar riff again except with such a powerful bass note and kick drum to go alongside it; I love it. The entire bridge section makes the verse after it until the end of the song hit so much harder than that at the beginning of the song.
