I cannot begin to describe how excited it was to hear the opening notes to this song at the beginning of the Sessanta concert. A Perfect Circle was one of the defining bands of 2022 for me, so finally getting to see them live made me unbelievably giddy. Even if Porcupine Tree and Between the Buried and Me were my favorite bands at the times I saw them at their respective concerts, I don't think either of them felt as important to see live to me than this band.

As for the song itself, Maynard's singing here has such a cool creepiness factor with it all the way through. It's so unsettling. And hearing this song for the first time has a big surprise in it, too, with how sudden the heavy riff comes in halfway through â€” which really exemplifies the dynamic tone that this record, and this band, offers. After that point, Maynard's voice is full of this insatiable greed, this lust for "the package." And his whispers as the song calms back down send a chill up your spine. It's as if the character of this song is acting like that whole heavy part never happened, attempting to lure you into a false sense of security, although you can still hear the desire in his voice in the final "mine"s of the song.
