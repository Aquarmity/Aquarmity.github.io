This song was my introduction to A Perfect Circle, and while it's definitely not my favorite of theirs anymore, I can't understate the importance of this song to me. Coming from Tool, this band was noticeably different from the second I started listening to this song. Admittedly, it took a couple months after listening to this song (I found the band a bit [underwhelming](/lyricwall/the-underwhelming) at first), but A Perfect Circle became one of my obsessions for some time, and certainly one that has held up as I write this nearly 3 years later. The guitar lick at 1:49 leading into the second verse is awesome, and Paz Lenchantin in the [music video](https://youtu.be/xTgKRCXybSM?t=112) is so badass at this moment (I really dig the music video's dark and desaturated colors). 2:16 is also pretty awesome in a way I can't put into words, and brings us to the song's finale which, between the guitar, the backup vocals, and the drums, has a real power behind it.
