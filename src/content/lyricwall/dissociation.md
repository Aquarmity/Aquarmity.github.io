The Dillinger Escape Plan has *some* calmer songs (Mouth of Ghosts, sort of?) but, of what I've heard from them, this is one of the least Dillinger-sounding Dillinger songs. No screaming, no dissonant guitar playing in some crazy time signature, just Greg Puciato singing these uncharacteristically somber, long notes, backed by some orchestral instruments, drums, and the bass. The song gains energy in the second half with the drums picking up, but it can't last; the instruments soon enough fade out, leaving only Greg repeating "finding a way to die alone."

For being Dillinger's final song, this feels rather fitting. They could've had one of their typical angsty, in-your-face songs, but they pulled back. They were this flying-high, uncontrollable fireball of a band, but their light must extinguish eventually. This song is the flame burning out.

Even the title, Dissociation, hits me with a certain feeling of melancholy.
