The first song to stick out to me from this album, and for good reason. The highlight here for me is having all three of Mastodon's lead singers switching off. For being Brann Dailor's debut lead vocals song, he does a lovely job (especially given how hard he goes on the drums in practically every Mastodon song â€” here, his performance in the intro speaks for itself). Troy Sanders carries the pre-chorus, bringing the song to Brent Hinds's chorus which has easily my favorite lyrics of the songs. Plus, his guitarwork in the bridge is perfect.
