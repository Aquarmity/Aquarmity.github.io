Possibly the greatest beginning to a band's debut album ever. 2:10, with the whispered "screaming" back into the chorus, combined with Billy Howerdel's guitar tone at that moment, never gets old (Howerdel's guitar tone is absolutely perfect on Mer de Noms, he created magic. [Judith](/lyricwall/judith) is another great example). In just under 3 minutes, the band captured their essence perfectly. My only wish is for the song to be a bit longer.
