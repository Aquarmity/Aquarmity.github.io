Even if it repeats a fair bit, the lyrics in this song are just so catchy, and it helps that Milla Jovovich has such a great voice. I don't think I'm normally a huge fan of voice cracks in singing, but Jovovich pulls it off in the lyric above. The instruments don't have a whole lot going on, but keep an important rhythm to support the vocals. The chorus of this song is addicting, and the variations on it building up throughout the song are great; I notice Puscifer does this in other songs as well (see [The Humbling River](/lyricwall/the-humbling-river)), and they do it well.
