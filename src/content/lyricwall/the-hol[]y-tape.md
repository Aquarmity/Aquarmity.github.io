As with many songs by this band, the highlights to me are in the vocals and the guitar. Here, particularly "Your color, I wonder" (0:45) and the quoted lyric (1:03–1:22) have awesome deliveries, but the latter especially works so amazingly well with the short pause before it — the guitar slide as the drums and bass stop — and the guitar and bass riffs that follow. 3:09–end also has a really cool guitar build up, then becomes this beautiful, soft outro I really like.

As of the time I'm writing this, I'm currently reading <span style="color: #6570ae">House</span> of Leaves, and finally got to the part that the title of this song references. Seeing <span style="white-space: pre">"The Hol[     ]y Tape"</span> was pretty exciting for me ("they said the thing!!" type thing).
