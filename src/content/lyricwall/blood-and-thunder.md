This album, but more specifically this song, but more specifically the bridge Neil Fallon sings, is the sole reason I bought Moby Dick. I've yet to read it as of writing this, but some day! I was sold by the imagery (helped a bit too much by [this](https://youtu.be/bpoAcXu65TM) video), which makes Ahab's battle against the whale and his desire to kill it seem so intense.

This was my first Mastodon song, as it likely is for many people, and it doesn't disappoint with its iconic guitar riff, the *constant* drum fills, and the shouts of **WHITE WHALE, HOLY GRAIL**.
