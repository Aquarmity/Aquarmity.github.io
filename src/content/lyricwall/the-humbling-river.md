Maynard James Keenan seems to have a thing for rivers, and by extension I do too (I mean, look at the name of this website). I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert at poetry analysis or anything, but this song portrays, well, being humbled by something so simple really well. "I've conquered country, crown, and throne", yet a simple river stands in the way. It speaks a lot to humility, giving in and giving up your pride. Some challenges can't be overcome alone.
