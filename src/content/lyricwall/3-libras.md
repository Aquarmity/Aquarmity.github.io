I really could've picked any line from this song, it's all incredibly beautiful and powerful. I would've chosen the "you don't see me" part, but it's really something you need to listen to rather than read. In 2022 this was the A Perfect Circle song I listened to the most, and it's become really nostalgic to me for that reason. I think of all the songs that weren't played at the Sessanta concert, this is the one I wanted to hear the most.
